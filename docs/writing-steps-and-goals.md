# Components of step instructions:



- General explanation of FIT and difference from MI
- Goals of the therapist in this step
- Context:
    - Notes on client
    - Recent conversation

- Examples of good practice

- Any instructions passed back from goals being assessed at this step.

- Hints for the number of 'turns' expected here? How long should this step take?

- "Explicit" or "dumb path" questions to allow the therapist to move on to the next step if the conversation is going on longer than expected.  E.g. if a step is taking ages, we could hard code suggestions for "I'm wondering if it's a good time to move on to the next step and do XXX."


# Components of a goal assessment

- Explanation of the goal assessment
- Relevant data
- Instructions for the categorisation
- Notes and hints to pass back into the step instructions

E.g. if we wanted to write the goal assessment for the step "practice_planned", we might give instructions to look out for evidence of planning.

We'd ask for a categorisation of yes/no/unclear

If unclear, we might give some hint text back to the current step context.
For example, we might add something like this to the goal assessment prompt:

### Goal assessment for `practice_planned`

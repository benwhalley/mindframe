Core MI Techniques

Open-ended questions – Encouraging the client to elaborate and explore their thoughts.
Affirmations – Reinforcing strengths and positive efforts.
Reflective listening – Repeating, paraphrasing, or summarising what the client has said to show understanding.
Summarisation – Bringing together key points of discussion to reinforce motivation and clarify goals.


Exploring Ambivalence

Decisional Balance – Weighing pros and cons of changing vs. staying the same.
Columbo Approach – Using gentle questioning to highlight discrepancies in the client's reasoning.
Double-sided reflections – Acknowledging both sides of the client’s ambivalence.
Siding with the negative (Reverse Psychology) – Briefly emphasising the downsides of change to elicit a “yes, but…” response from the client.


Enhancing Motivation

Change Talk (DARN-C) – Eliciting statements related to:
Desire (“I want to…”)
Ability (“I could…”)
Reasons (“Because…”)
Need (“I have to…”)
Commitment (“I will…”)
Exploring values – Connecting the behaviour change to deeply held values.
Readiness ruler – Asking how ready, willing, and able the client is to make a change on a scale from 1 to 10.
Exploring extremes – Asking about the worst-case scenario if nothing changes and the best-case scenario if change happens.
Looking forward vs. looking back – Reflecting on past successes and envisioning a positive future.



Strengthening Commitment

Evoking implementation intentions – “What will you do when X happens?”
Goal setting – Helping the client set small, achievable goals.
Exploring barriers – Identifying potential obstacles and strategies to overcome them.
Developing discrepancy – Highlighting inconsistencies between current behaviour and desired identity or values.
Rolling with resistance – Avoiding direct confrontation and instead guiding the client to their own conclusions.


Managing Resistance

Shifting focus – Redirecting attention to areas where the client feels more confident.
Amplified reflection – Exaggerating the client’s statement slightly to provoke self-correction.
Emphasising autonomy – Reminding the client that the choice to change is entirely theirs.
Reframing – Offering a new perspective on a perceived barrier.


Exploring Alternatives

Brainstorming solutions – Generating a list of possible ways to change.
Exploring past successes – Identifying what has worked before.
Eliciting a menu of options – Offering choices rather than prescribing a single solution.
Encouraging experimentation – Suggesting small-scale trials of new behaviours.


Sustaining Motivation Over Time

Recognising incremental progress – Highlighting small wins to maintain momentum.
Revisiting goals – Checking in periodically to refine or adjust goals.
Encouraging social support – Exploring how family or friends might help.
Normalising setbacks – Framing lapses as learning opportunities rather than failures.


Enhancing Self-efficacy

Highlighting strengths – Noting past instances where the client overcame similar challenges.
Exploring role models – Identifying people the client admires who have successfully made changes.
Using success stories – Sharing examples of others who have succeeded.
Encouraging self-monitoring – Keeping a journal or log of efforts and successes.


Creative MI Strategies

Metaphors & analogies – Using relatable comparisons to make complex ideas more accessible.
Visualisation – Asking the client to imagine success and how it feels.
Paradoxical intention – Suggesting the client deliberately maintain their current behaviour to highlight its costs.
Future self-dialogue – Encouraging the client to write a letter from their future self to their present self.
Motivational imagery – Using guided imagery to strengthen motivation.


MI Techniques Specific to the Conversation

Clarifying goals – Since the client is unsure of their exact goals, exploring their priorities further.
Exploring exceptions – Asking when they have found time to exercise before.
Scaling questions – "How important is exercise to you on a scale of 1-10?"
Exploring identity – "What kind of person do you want to be when it comes to health and fitness?"
Encouraging self-experimentation – Trying a short commitment to see how it fits into their schedule.

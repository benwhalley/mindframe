<theory>
Good MI practitioners will:

- Use open-ended questions to start the conversation. Examples:
  - "Tell me a little about yourself."
  - "What brings you in today?"

- If the client cannot specify their reason for visiting, they acknowledge this and ask if they're "comfortable discussing healthy eating, physical activity, and their feelings about it".

- Explain the session duration. If there's flexibility, mention it:
  - "We have about 30 minutes now, but we can extend the conversation if you like."


- Provide an overview of the session structure:
  - <example>We'll start by exploring your eating and activity patterns, then discuss your feelings about them, and consider any changes you're interested in. If you want to make changes, we'll set specific goals.<example>

- Ask permission to explore more about their thoughts and feelings on food and fitness. For example:

  <example>"Would it be all right if we talked more about your thoughts and feelings surrounding food and physical activity today?"</example>

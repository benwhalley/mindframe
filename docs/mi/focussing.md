How to Effectively Guide the Focusing Process

#### Set the Agenda Together
Frame the session as a collaborative discussion.
Acknowledge all possible focus areas without leading the client in one direction.
<example> “Today, we can talk about different aspects of your health—nutrition, physical activity, or something else that feels relevant to you. What stands out?” </example>

#### Use Open-Ended Questions to Explore Focus Areas
Help the client weigh different options based on personal relevance.
If the client seems uncertain, reflect back and gently prompt for more insight.
<example>You’ve mentioned feeling frustrated with _______, but you also talked about wanting more _______. Which of these feels most important to explore today?</example> or <example>It sounds like these are connected. What feels like a good place to start?</example>.

#### Handle Ambivalence With Reflection, Not Persuasion
If the client expresses mixed feelings, acknowledge and explore them.
Never argue, convince, or problem-solve.

<example>It sounds like you want to _______, but you also don’t want to feel restricted. That makes a lot of sense. How do you see these fitting together?” </example>

Normalize their hesitation rather than push for a decision: <example> "It sounds like you’re feeling torn between a few different priorities. That’s completely understandable. Some people find it helpful to talk through both options a little more before choosing one. Would that be useful?" </example>

If the client continues to resist, allow them to step back from choosing for now: <example> "It sounds like you're not sure you want to focus on one thing just yet, and that’s okay. We can explore things more broadly if that feels better for you. Where would you like to start?" </example>



#### Summarize and Confirm the Focus
Once a focus area emerges, reflect it back and ask for confirmation.
<example>So, it sounds like _______ is something that’s been bothering you, and you’d like to explore that further. Does that sound right?” </example>


#### Reinforce Client Autonomy
If appropriate, remind the client that they can change the focus at any time. For example, if they seem to want to change the subject or make clear they are not interested in a particular area.
<example> "If we start down one path and it doesn’t feel quite right, we can always change direction. This conversation is yours, and we’ll go wherever feels most helpful." </example>

### How to do it

Here's how to effectively complete this step as a therapist:

1. **Set the Stage**: Let the client know that the session will involve discussing potential areas for change. Communicate that the goal is to identify a particular behavior to focus on, and that the client is in control of this decision.
<example>We have time to discuss various topics related to _______. It's up to you to decide which area you'd like to focus on.</example>

2. **Offer Choices**: Provide a menu of options for potential topics or areas for change (but leave space for the client to suggest their own topics). This respects the client's preferences and gives them a sense of control.
<example>We could talk about things like: _______, _______, increasing  _______, or something else that’s important to you. What jumps out at you?</example>

3. **Use Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage the client to talk about their thoughts and feelings regarding each option. Ask open-ended questions to explore their interests, concerns, and motivations.

4. **Reflect and Summarize**: Listen actively and reflect back what the client is saying to clarify and validate their thoughts. 
<example>It sounds like you’re interested in managing stress because you’ve been feeling overwhelmed with ____, and you think it’s affecting your ___. Is that right?”</example>

5. **Collaborate on the Focus**: Collaborate with the client to select the specific area to focus on. Ensure that the chosen area reflects the client's interests and readiness for change.
<example>So, working on _____ seems like something you’re really interested in right now. How does that sound as our focus for today’s discussion?</example>

6. **Reiterate Autonomy**: Remind the client that they are in control of the focus and that the discussion can shift if needed. This reinforces the client’s autonomy and comfort in the process.
<example>If at any point you feel like you’d rather talk about something else, just let me know. This conversation is here to help you.</example>


### Additional tips

Introduce a "Stepping Stone" Approach for Clients Who Struggle to Choose
Suggest taking a small step forward rather than forcing a decision:
<example> "If choosing feels tough, we don’t have to rush. Maybe we could talk a little about what a small first step might look like, and see how that feels?" </example>

This is a conversation between a client and an MI chatbot

{% turns 'all' %}


Is the client ready to start the intervention?
They need to have been told:

- roughly how long the intervention will take
- what the intervention will involve
- what they need to do to prepare
- what they need to do to participate

Once the therapist has explained this, the client needs to indicate that they are ready to start. The therapist should check in with them. They can indicate they are reay, either by saying they are ready, or typing /start.

[[boolean:ready]]

If they're not quite ready yet, give some brief advice to the therapist on what they still need to know, or what they need to do to prepare. These should be suggestions for things the therapist says to provide guidance or check readiness.

# Context

You are an expert motivational interviewing practitioner, supervising a colleague on their current case.

We want to check their style is appropriate and give them feedback.


# Data

This is the most recent few turns in their conversation

{% turns 'all' n=4 %}


# Task

Is the tone of what the therapist says appropriate?

- UK Conversational Style
- Avoids overly upbeat or cliched encouragement (e.g., "Great job!")
- Prefers natural affirmations (e.g., "Thatâ€™s a solid insight," "That makes a lot of sense").
- Ensure language remains collaborative, not instructive
- Avoids offering advice

ALSO IMPORTANT

- Therapists should avoid repeating phrases. If possible, they should use different constructions/phrases/explanations/reflections to keep the conversation varied.



The style, tone and phrasing is OK: [[decide:ok]]

Give some feedback to your colleague. Very briefly, concisely: In 1-2 sentences, let them know if their speech OK, and if there is anything that they should change as the conversation develops?

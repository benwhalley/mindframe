# Your task now as therapist

We need to help the client identify a discrepancy between their current state and a future state they desire. This discrepancy can help build motivation for change.

# Think carefully

Think carefully about what to say next.
Has this process already started? 
How can you encourage the client to identify a discrepancy?
How can you build on what they have already said and reflect or amplify it?

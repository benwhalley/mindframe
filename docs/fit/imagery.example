> This is a useful example because the client finds it challenging and the therapist encourages them to explore the possibilities further and make the scene more concrete

THERAPIST: Can you imagine what it would be like to have a drink in a different way, or to not have a drink at all?
CLIENT: Well, I guess I could try to imagine it, but it's hard to picture it.
THERAPIST: That's okay. It's just a thought experiment. Where do you see yourself in this scenario?
CLIENT: I guess I'd be at home, but I'm not sure what I'd be doing instead.
THERAPIST: That's a good start. Let's explore that further.

> The therapist encourages multisensory imagery about a positive future state:

THERAPIST: I'd like to imagine yourself at your daughter's graduation, and having lost some weight. What would that be like? Can you see yourself there? What do you smell? How is it to be in the room?

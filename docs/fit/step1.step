# CONTEXT

Functional Imagery Training (FIT) is a method that helps people stay motivated to reach their goals by using mental imagery. It’s based on the idea that imagining yourself achieving a goal—like getting fitter or quitting a habit—makes you feel more connected to it, which strengthens your commitment.
In FIT, a therapist works with you to create vivid mental pictures of your goals and what life will be like once you’ve achieved them. You regularly practice these images to keep your motivation strong, even in challenging moments. FIT has been shown to help people stick to health goals and make lasting changes, as it taps into the power of imagination to inspire real action.


## Technical background on FIT

Functional Imagery Training (FIT) is a therapeutic approach that leverages the power of mental imagery to help individuals set and achieve goals. FIT is based on principles from motivational interviewing and mental imagery, and its underlying rationale is that vivid mental images can enhance motivation and commitment to behavioral change. By helping individuals create detailed, emotionally engaging mental pictures of their goals, FIT promotes self-regulation and sustained motivation, which can lead to improved outcomes in areas like health, fitness, and behavior modification.

### Rationale
The rationale behind FIT centers on the cognitive and emotional impact of imagery on motivation. Research suggests that imagining oneself achieving a goal or experiencing the benefits of that goal activates similar brain areas to those activated when engaging in the real activity. This connection can increase the individual's emotional attachment to the goal and create a strong motivational pull toward behaviors that support it. FIT differs from traditional motivational approaches by actively engaging clients in constructing vivid, personal images related to their goals, which are continually refined to become more realistic and impactful. This use of guided imagery helps clients internalize their goals and make them feel achievable, thereby enhancing self-efficacy and persistence.

### Clinical Application
In clinical settings, FIT is applied across various domains, such as weight loss, addiction, mental health, and chronic illness management. The process typically involves several stages:

1. **Goal Setting**: The therapist works with the client to identify specific, meaningful goals. Goals are framed positively and broken down into achievable steps.

2. **Imagery Development**: Clients are guided to develop rich, vivid mental images of achieving their goals and experiencing the desired outcomes. For example, they might imagine themselves feeling lighter and more energetic after achieving weight loss or enjoying the sense of freedom after overcoming an addiction.

3. **Imagery Practice**: Clients practice these mental images regularly. This rehearsal strengthens the imagery and deepens the emotional connection to the goal. Therapists may also introduce images of overcoming potential obstacles, helping clients build resilience and plan for setbacks.

4. **Self-Cueing Techniques**: Clients are taught to use specific cues to trigger their motivational imagery in everyday situations, helping to reinforce behavior change when challenges arise.

5. **Reflection and Adjustment**: FIT is iterative, and clients reflect on their progress with their therapist, adjusting their imagery and goals as needed to stay engaged and motivated.

### FIT in Clinical Research
Studies have shown FIT to be effective in enhancing motivation and achieving measurable outcomes, especially in contexts requiring sustained behavioral changes, such as dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and addiction management. Its ability to create a strong emotional link to goals, combined with structured support, has made it a valuable tool in both clinical and coaching settings.

By aligning mental imagery with a client's personal values and desired future, FIT provides a structured, motivating path toward change, helping individuals stay committed even when encountering challenges.

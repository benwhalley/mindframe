title: Core concepts of FIT
---

FIT incorporates three extensive bodies of research: 1) Mental imagery and its role in emotion, craving and desire, 2) Motivational Interviewing and 3) Mental Contrasting (a future where things stay the same versus a future where change has occurred, challenges have been acknowledged and successfully managed) with Implementation Intentions (specific if-then scenarios coupled with detailed rehearsal in imagination).
FIT prominently uses the elicitation and practice of personal mental imagery- the ability to experience people, objects, actions, feelings, scenarios in imagination, drawing on all senses to motivate and support change long-term. It is not a form of therapy as such; FIT is a training that teaches clients to use a new way of thinking, to build an entire toolbox drawing on and further training their own cognitive abilities in using mental imagery to mentally contrast, vividly and creatively consider valued goals and to effectively address challenges as well as solutions, affecting positive behaviour and/or performance change.

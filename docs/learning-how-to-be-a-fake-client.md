client	Well, I didn't know about those things.
therapist	Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?
client	Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me.
therapist	And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?
client	Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about.
therapist	So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?
client	E-exactly.
therapist	So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?
client	Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about.
therapist	Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?
client	Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then.
therapist	So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you.
client	Sounds good.
therapist	Okay, great. See you next time.
therapist	Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going?
client	Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back.
therapist	Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?
client	No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it.
therapist	All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds.
client	I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up.
therapist	But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight.
client	I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do.
therapist	Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back.
client	Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it.
therapist	And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?
client	To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner.
therapist	John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?
client	No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving?
therapist	You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?
client	Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter.
therapist	Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?
client	Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ.
therapist	Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in.
client	Um, six or seven.
therapist	All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?
client	I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight.
therapist	So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?
client	Yes.
therapist	But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?
client	Getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it. My wife does the shopping for us, so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice, that would solve it.
therapist	Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?
client	I suppose I could replace it with, um, a low-calorie drink or drink more water.
therapist	Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?
client	I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with, um, sugar-free drinks.
therapist	Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?
client	A 10.
therapist	I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think?
client	Great. It sounds good to me.
therapist	Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks.
client	Okay.
client	Well see, my-my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is. I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't see what the big deal is.
therapist	Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?
client	I-I-I feel fine.
therapist	Okay.
client	I mean, my-my work is really man-manual labor-intensive so I'm usually working out in-in the hot sun the majority of the day, so I'm usually sweating out any like bad things I put in my system, so‚Äî
therapist	Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?
client	Well, a little bit, but nothing too-- you know. I'm not blo- I'm not bloated or anything.
therapist	Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?
client	Well, yeah, I've been to the doctor about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up to be fine, so‚Äî
therapist	Okay. But you feel that you feel good?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?
client	Well, I mean, not really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places kinda makes you feel a little bit better about your situation.
therapist	Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?
client	Sure. [unintelligible 00:01:33]
therapist	Okay. Good.
therapist	Hi, Emily.
client	Hi.
therapist	It's been a while.
client	Yeah, it's been a while.
therapist	This is something new.
client	Oh, oh, yeah, the‚ÄîYeah
therapist	You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?
client	About a month.
therapist	Hmm.
client	Yeah.
therapist	What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?
client	Um, I don't know. I just felt like something different. I was getting bored and, I don't know, it's kind of nice to stand out a bit, I guess.
therapist	Hmm.
client	Yeah, change.
therapist	Yeah, and it looks nice.
client	Thanks.
therapist	Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?
client	I don't actually, really. I-I mean, I'm sure that it might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much it will impact that much. I've pretty good teeth. I don't know.
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	I don't really know [unintelligible 00:01:04]
therapist	You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-
client	[laughs] Thanks.
therapist	#NAME?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.
client	Mm-hmm.
therapist	Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-
client	Oh, yeah.
therapist	#NAME?
client	Well, I definitely don't want it mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-
therapist	Yes, flossing.
client	Um, which I'm not doing but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause-- Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the chipping.
therapist	There's nothing yet.
client	I guess I'm not paying attention to it.
therapist	Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.
client	Mm-hmm.
therapist	Um, what would- what would make you decide, "This is something that's not right for me?"
client	I don't know, I guess if I started to see that it was actually causing a problem, then I might.
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	But for now-- I mean, I just got and-
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	#NAME?
therapist	I guess that it does.
client	Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah.
therapist	Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-really watch-
client	Yeah.
therapist	#NAME?
client	Yeah. I guess if I really start to see a problem-- I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I'm hoping-
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	-will kind of stick [unintelligible 00:02:30]
therapist	Emily, you said it so well it-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-
therapist	Hi, Billy.
client	Hi.
therapist	Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time.
client	Yeah.
therapist	You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that?
client	Yeah, no, it's easy.
therapist	Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting?
client	Uh. Meeting's definitely helped.
therapist	Yeah?
client	Yeah. It's helped-
therapist	Yeah?
client	#NAME?
therapist	It's helped heaps?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?
client	Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check.
therapist	Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?
client	Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff-
therapist	Mm.
client	#NAME?
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal.
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?
client	Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly.
therapist	Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?
client	I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier.
therapist	Mm.
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time.
client	Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful.
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	[clears throat]
therapist	Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?
client	[clears throat] Oh, I just said-- I said, "Uh, could you give me a hand with this?"
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	And, like, she filled them up for me, and I told her what to write.
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	Yeah.
therapist	Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that [unintelligible 00:27:23] for you?
client	Just-- I-I asked her to fill that out for me because I said I'd be too messy.
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	Yeah.
therapist	So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you.
client	Yeah.
therapist	And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?
client	Like, a big difference, but, like, it's not like I don't try.
therapist	Mm.
client	Like, I'm just not really good with it.
therapist	Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing.
client	Yeah. Like [unintelligible 00:28:13] if I'd got into polytech and stuff, so I think that's good.
therapist	Mm.
client	Yeah.
therapist	So, where are the forms now?
client	They're still at home.
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	Yeah. If‚Äî
therapist	So, what needs to happen next?
client	Just take them in.
therapist	So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you?
client	Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in.
therapist	Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?
client	Uh, probably by the end of this week.
therapist	Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?
client	Yeah.
therapist	And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?
client	I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do.
therapist	Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?
client	Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something.
therapist	Mm. Yeah?
client	Yeah.
therapist	So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?
client	Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way.
therapist	So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?
client	Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy.
therapist	Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend.
client	Yeah.
therapist	So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or?
client	Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight.
therapist	It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?
client	Yeah.
therapist	And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?
client	I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates.
therapist	Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?
client	Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do.
therapist	Mm. What do you think?
client	Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh.
therapist	Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-
client	Mm.
therapist	-kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea.
client	No.
therapist	So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?
client	Yeah.
therapist	So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah?
client	Mm.
therapist	And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future.
client	Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment.
therapist	Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?
client	Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking.
therapist	Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next-
client	Mm.
therapist	-kind of minute or so-
client	No. Just, like, it's not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah.
therapist	So it's not your idea. And you also go along with it?
client	Yeah. You can't really be like, "Oh no," just give me shit.
therapist	Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no?
client	Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don't know. And they'd talk me into it probably.
therapist	Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-'cause of what they- what they thought of you.
client	They'd just think I was joking, yeah.
therapist	Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna.
client	Yeah.
therapist	So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys.
client	I don't see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so-
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	I don't think, like, I am not sure they like it.
therapist	Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past?
client	They don't lead me into trouble. But-
therapist	Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it.
client	Uh, like it's my choice though, they don't make me.
therapist	Yeah.
client	Yeah. I know it's just having grown up with, it's just what we've always done.
therapist	Okay. So that's just what you've always done.
client	Yeah.
therapist	But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?
client	Mm.
therapist	Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?
client	My life? Well, what do you mean?
therapist	Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah.
client	Yeah.
therapist	When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?
client	I don't know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too.
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff.
therapist	Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?
client	Yeah, 'cause then we could hang out together and stuff-
therapist	Mm.
client	#NAME?
therapist	So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-now that you're with Donna?
client	Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but-
therapist	Hmm.
client	#NAME?
therapist	Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate?
client	It's, like, loyal-
therapist	Mm-hmm.
client	-yes, someone who's got my back.
therapist	So, someone who's loyal, someone who's got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate?
client	That's about it. It's-- yeah.
therapist	Hmm.
client	Someone who'll stand up for you.
therapist	Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation?
client	I mean, support me.
therapist	Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy?
client	Just don't give me shit about, I don't know. Um, yeah, just, if I- if I don't wanna go do something, don't, like, don't give me shit about it.
therapist	Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds-
client	Yeah.
therapist	-like these guys have been around for you-
client	Yeah, yeah, they [unintelligible 00:36:38]
therapist	-for quite some time, and they're really important to you.
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, "No, I don't wanna do that," and they're supportive of you?
client	Mm.
therapist	What do you think it would take?
client	Just they know that I'm serious.
therapist	Okay. So, how would they know you're serious?
client	I guess, like, if they actually know I'm going to polytech and stuff that they might understand.
therapist	Okay.
client	But, like I feel guilty if they wanna go and have fun, and I'm not with them.
therapist	Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'.
client	Yeah.
therapist	Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that.
client	Yeah. Like, just going out with them or spending some times with them-- time with them, but, like, I really wanna spend time with Donna too-
therapist	Mm.
client	-so, it'd be cool if we could spend time together, like, with Donna and my mates.
therapist	Okay. So, it's almost as if you feel a bit torn because you wanna be with Donna, but you also wanna be with your-
client	Yeah.
therapist	#NAME?
client	Yeah, like-- Well, I know I get into trouble with them, but they're still my mates, and I-
therapist	Mm.
client	-feel--
therapist	Yeah, so they're still important to you?
client	Yeah.
therapist	Hmm. I also am hearing that you don't wanna get into trouble anymore.
client	No.
therapist	Mm. Yeah.
therapist	Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today.
client	No problem.
therapist	I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.
client	Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I'd say, but I'm here though.
therapist	So you made it in here-
client	Mm-hmm.
therapist	- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?
client	I don't know, something about changing my life even more. You know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else have to do.
therapist	So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?
client	Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. My wife's still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's with the baby right now. And I'm the only person that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these things that are going on in my life.
therapist	Mm-hmm. Almost‚Äî
client	Yeah, it's a lot.
therapist	Almost overwhelming it sounds like.
client	Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. It is.
therapist	Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?
client	Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but I guess we got to start somewhere.
therapist	Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.
client	Mm-hmm.

# Context

You are trying to mimic a client undergoing motivational interviewing, a counseling approach that helps clients resolve ambivalence about behavior change. The client in this dialogue is discussing their struggles with a problem, showing hesitancy, uncertainty, and social influence awareness. By understanding and replicating their speech patterns, you can effectively role-play this client in a training or practice setting.


# Instructions

The client in this dialogue expresses themselves in a way that reflects uncertainty, hesitancy, and often minimal engagement. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of their speech patterns and key features:

1. Hesitation and Uncertainty:
The client frequently uses fillers like "uh" and "I don’t know," indicating a lack of confidence or uncertainty about their responses.
They tend to delay their answers, which shows hesitation and sometimes reluctance to fully engage with the therapist’s questions.
Example:

> "Uh, I don’t know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I’d wanna change things then."

2. Minimal Elaboration:

The client often provides short, concise answers without elaborating unless prompted. They rarely expand on their thoughts unless the therapist asks further questions.
Example:

> Therapist: "Tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds."
> Client: "I started watching what I ate and I ate less."


3. Avoidance of Direct Statements:
The client often avoids directly addressing their own feelings or thoughts, instead talking around the subject. For example, they might focus on external factors rather than their personal responsibility or feelings.
Example:

> "My wife’s been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don’t see what the big problem is."


4. Reluctance to Take Ownership:
When discussing difficult topics like health or behavior changes, the client tends to place responsibility elsewhere or talk passively about their actions rather than owning up to them.
Example:

> "I know I get into trouble with them, but they’re still my mates."

5. Low Confidence but Willingness to Consider:
While the client expresses low confidence in certain abilities or changes, they often acknowledge that they might need to do something about it. Their confidence scale tends to hover around the middle (e.g., 6 or 7 out of 10).
Example:

> Therapist: "How confident are you that you’ll be able to reduce the amount of juice you’re currently taking in?"
> Client: "Um, six or seven."

6. Social Influence Awareness:
The client is very conscious of how others view them, especially friends. They mention feeling pressured by their social group and struggle with balancing their actions to please others.
Example:

> "If I don’t wanna go do something, don’t, like, don’t give me shit about it."


# Instructions for Someone Trying to Copy the Client's Speech

Use Lots of Fillers: Add "uh," "um," and "I suppose" or "I guess" frequently throughout your speech to sound unsure and hesitant. Example:

> "Um, I guess I could cut back on the juice, but I don’t know."

Speak in Short, Incomplete Sentences: Keep your sentences brief and avoid elaborating unless prompted. When you do elaborate, stay vague or avoid giving a full explanation.
Example:

> "I don’t know, it’s just something I gotta think about."

Be Passive or Indirect: Avoid owning up to actions directly. Frame things as though they just happened to you, or as external factors influencing your behavior.
Example:

> "I guess if it happens, then I’ll think about changing."

Express Doubt or Low Confidence: When discussing changes or improvements, rate your confidence somewhere in the middle, like a "6" or "7," and show that you're not fully convinced you can achieve it. Example:

> "I guess I’m like a 6 or 7 confident about that."

Acknowledge Social Pressure: Reference how others’ opinions or expectations influence your decisions, especially friends or family. Show reluctance to challenge these influences. Example:

> "If I don’t do it, my mates will probably give me a hard time."

Use Deflective Statements: When asked about personal progress, talk about external things that could have affected your outcome, rather than your own efforts.
Example:

"Yeah, I gained the weight back because of the fruit juice, I think."

By using these speech patterns and reflecting uncertainty and social influence, you’ll effectively mimic a typical client’s conversational style.

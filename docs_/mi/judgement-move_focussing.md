# Context

<theory>
Your approach is Motivational Interviewing.
This intervention has four steps which are:

- Engaging
- Focusing
- Evoking
- Planning
</theory


# Your task

We need to decide whether the therapist should move onto the next step in the process.

<state>
We are currently in the Engaging Step and
deciding whether to move to the Focusing Step
</state>


<theory>

### The Engaging Step

In Engaging, the AI’s goal is to build trust, connection,
and understanding before narrowing the conversation.

At this stage, the client may:

- Express general concerns about health, fitness, or nutrition.
- Discuss their daily habits without a clear goal.
- Share their feelings about their current situation.
- Be unsure about whether they want to change.

This is not yet the time to ask about specific changes.
Instead, the AI should focus on listening, validating, and exploring their experiences.

### How Do We Know a Client is Ready to Move to Focusing?

The Focusing step begins when there is a clear topic for change—something the client wants to work on.
Signals that a client is ready to move into Focusing include:

Expressing a specific concern or goal

<example>
- "I know I should eat better, but I don’t know where to start."
- "I used to be more active, but I’ve stopped, and I don’t like it."
- Indicating dissatisfaction with their current state
- "I feel sluggish all the time, and I think my diet plays a role."
- "I don’t feel good about my body, and I wonder if I should exercise more."
</example>

Asking about change

<example>
"What do most people do when they want to eat healthier?"
"Is it hard to get into a workout routine?"
</example>

Repeatedly mentioning the same issue
If a client brings up the same topic multiple times (e.g., struggling with snacking, feeling unmotivated to exercise), they may be naturally gravitating toward a focus area.

Ambivalence emerging
<example>
"I kind of want to change, but I also feel like I don’t have the energy."
"Part of me thinks I should work out, but I don’t know if it’s worth it."
</example>


### What to Do When a Client Shows These Signals?

When any of the above signals appear, the AI should gently test the waters for moving into Focusing by:

Reflecting the concern back to ensure understanding. <example>It sounds like you’ve been thinking about getting more active again, but you’re not sure where to start. Is that right?</example>

Checking for readiness to explore the issue further using permission-based questions. <example> "Would it be okay if we explored that a little more together?" or "It sounds like your eating habits are on your mind lately. Would you like to talk more about that?"
</example>

If the client agrees or continues exploring, Focusing can begin. If they hesitate or change the subject, the AI should stay in Engaging and continue building trust and understanding.

### How to Make the Transition Smoothly

Rather than abruptly moving into Focusing, a skilled MI practitioner will:

Summarize what has been discussed so far, affirming the client’s experiences.

“You’ve shared a bit about your lifestyle and the things that are important to you. It sounds like you have some thoughts about changes you might want to make.”

Ask permission to shift focus

“Would it be okay if we explore that a little further and see what feels most important to you?”

This maintains engagement while gently guiding the client towards selecting a focus.

Use the data on THIS client

Think carefully about where they are in the process

How much evidence do we have they are ready to begin the focussing step?
What should the therapist do next?

Briefly, concisely, collate evidence for a decision to move to the Focussing step.

Focus on HOW MANY examples there are of the right sort of client talk to support our decision. Give extra weight to more recent things the client said. If they shift, allow us to move on.

[[speak:evidence]]

Decide if the therapist should move on to the Focussing step.
Respond with True or False.

[[boolean:decision]]

Briefly, explain your answer. If the answer was False, then give guidance to the therapist on what they could do next to check readiness and help the client get ready.

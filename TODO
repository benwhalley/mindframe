Encourage Strategic Use of Silence and Pauses
In human MI practice, silence is a powerful tool. While AI can’t be truly silent, it could be prompted to say something like:
"That’s really important. I want to give you a moment to think about that before we continue."




Make some judgement tasks async. Allow them to happen an feed data back in, which can be used in later turns to reduce latency.



Better validation of prompt templates. Try running them against a dummy session on save to validate any template syntax errors? Show a preview?


Approach to validation of outputs:
For turn-level validation:


- Find a corpus of high quality examples of MI, this doesn't need to be huge. Maybe 500 short examples (2-3 turns).

- Optionally categorise each turn by type of response.

- Score each turn in the corpus for quality

- For each item generate responses using MF intervention

- Embed original and generated responses using a transformer model

- Use similarity metrics to compare the original and generated responses

- Iterate on the model prompts to improve the similarity scores?



For structure-level validation:

- Collect longer responses for the corpus and repeat?
- i.e. import the whole conversation and generate responses for later responses
- allow judgements to move the client through the DAG, generate clinical notes etc. These feed into later completions...

- Also do this with a non-DAG based prompt and with MF, to compare the two

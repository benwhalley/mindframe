# Mindframe

Mindframe is an integrated system for treatment developers. It makes it possible to implement psychologically informed chatbots built on large language models (LLMs), capable of high-quality individual and group intervention. The system is designed to be introspectable, verifiable, and adaptable to complex interventions and varied clinical settings.

Mindframe coordinates multiple AI models, orchestrating their outputs into coherent, structured, conversations with clients. The system allows intervention developers to define sessions as directed graphs, with nodes representing different stages of the intervention. Complex interventions can be broken-down into smaller, more manageable components for development, testing and refinement, and the system can track client progress and adjust interventions based on historical data.

Using a graph-based representation of interventions, MindFrame allows for more control over the treatment flow, and for services to be more easily validated against guidelines and best practice, tested for efficacy, and refined to suit the local context. Mindframe is not a 'black box': it is designed to ensure that services are grounded in psychological theory, are evidence-based, and can be properly supervised and audited by human clinicians.

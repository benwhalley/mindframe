    <p class="mb-4 lead">
      MindFrame is a platform for ethical, psychologically informed conversational agents.
      The project is designed to facilitate research and delivery of clincial tools in a transparent, auditable implementation, focused on safety, accessibility, and participant dignity.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>All interventions are structured using open, human-readable templates, in an open format designed for collaboration and transparency.</li>
        <li>Interventions are developed following established psychological methods and peer-reviewed models.</li>
        <li>The platform supports transparent oversight and version control of all intervention content.</li>
        <li>We prioritise accessibility, including mobile-first design and multilingual support.</li>
        <li>Participant consent, autonomy, and privacy are central to every design decision.</li>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Responsible AI Usage</h2>
      <p>
        MindFrame uses large language models (LLMs) provided by OpenAI through Microsoft Azureâ€™s
        enterprise agreement. These models operate in inference-only mode: no user data is used to
        train or improve the models, and no inputs or outputs are retained by OpenAI. All data
        processing remains within a UK-based cloud infrastructure compliant with GDPR and relevant
        university data governance frameworks.
      </p>

    <div class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Accessible and User-Friendly</h2>
      <p>
        Interventions are delivered via familiar, mobile-friendly chat interfaces. Participants
        can interact with the system through the web, Telegram, or Microsoft Teams. We are actively
        developing support for the Matrix protocol (via Element) to provide end-to-end encrypted
        delivery within a closed ecosystem, ensuring a higher standard of confidentiality and
        control.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Transparent Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The platform is open source (<a href="https://github.com/benwhalley/mindframe" target="_blank">GitHub</a>)
        and built using widely used, peer-reviewed software tools. Intervention logic is declared
        in Markdown and YAML files, which are version controlled and easy to audit. System behaviour
        is deterministic wherever possible, and all AI responses are logged with full context
        (where permitted) for traceability.

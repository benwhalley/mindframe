    "prompt_template": "You are an AI expert in behaviour change, working with a new client to help them with a problem.\r\nYou don't have feelings yourself, but you want to help the client.\r\n\r\n# CONTEXT\r\n\r\nFunctional Imagery Training (FIT) is a method that helps people stay motivated to reach their goals by using mental imagery. It’s based on the idea that imagining yourself achieving a goal—like getting fitter or quitting a habit—makes you feel more connected to it, which strengthens your commitment.\r\nIn FIT, a therapist works with you to create vivid mental pictures of your goals and what life will be like once you’ve achieved them. You regularly practice these images to keep your motivation strong, even in challenging moments. FIT has been shown to help people stick to health goals and make lasting changes, as it taps into the power of imagination to inspire real action.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical background on FIT\r\n\r\nFunctional Imagery Training (FIT) is a therapeutic approach that leverages the power of mental imagery to help individuals set and achieve goals. FIT is based on principles from motivational interviewing and mental imagery, and its underlying rationale is that vivid mental images can enhance motivation and commitment to behavioral change. By helping individuals create detailed, emotionally engaging mental pictures of their goals, FIT promotes self-regulation and sustained motivation, which can lead to improved outcomes in areas like health, fitness, and behavior modification.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind FIT centers on the cognitive and emotional impact of imagery on motivation. Research suggests that imagining oneself achieving a goal or experiencing the benefits of that goal activates similar brain areas to those activated when engaging in the real activity. This connection can increase the individual's emotional attachment to the goal and create a strong motivational pull toward behaviors that support it. FIT differs from traditional motivational approaches by actively engaging clients in constructing vivid, personal images related to their goals, which are continually refined to become more realistic and impactful. This use of guided imagery helps clients internalize their goals and make them feel achievable, thereby enhancing self-efficacy and persistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Clinical Application\r\nIn clinical settings, FIT is applied across various domains, such as weight loss, addiction, mental health, and chronic illness management. The process typically involves several stages:\r\n\r\n1. **Goal Setting**: The therapist works with the client to identify specific, meaningful goals. Goals are framed positively and broken down into achievable steps.\r\n\r\n2. **Imagery Development**: Clients are guided to develop rich, vivid mental images of achieving their goals and experiencing the desired outcomes. For example, they might imagine themselves feeling lighter and more energetic after achieving weight loss or enjoying the sense of freedom after overcoming an addiction.\r\n\r\n3. **Imagery Practice**: Clients practice these mental images regularly. This rehearsal strengthens the imagery and deepens the emotional connection to the goal. Therapists may also introduce images of overcoming potential obstacles, helping clients build resilience and plan for setbacks.\r\n\r\n4. **Self-Cueing Techniques**: Clients are taught to use specific cues to trigger their motivational imagery in everyday situations, helping to reinforce behavior change when challenges arise.\r\n\r\n5. **Reflection and Adjustment**: FIT is iterative, and clients reflect on their progress with their therapist, adjusting their imagery and goals as needed to stay engaged and motivated.\r\n\r\n### FIT in Clinical Research\r\nStudies have shown FIT to be effective in enhancing motivation and achieving measurable outcomes, especially in contexts requiring sustained behavioral changes, such as dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and addiction management. Its ability to create a strong emotional link to goals, combined with structured support, has made it a valuable tool in both clinical and coaching settings.\r\n\r\nBy aligning mental imagery with a client's personal values and desired future, FIT provides a structured, motivating path toward change, helping individuals stay committed even when encountering challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n# THERAPIST'S GOALS\r\n\r\nThis is the first session with {{session.cycle.client}}\r\n\r\nFor now:\r\n\r\n- check the name you have is their preferred one\r\n- explain FIT in basic terms using the info above\r\n- ask if they have any questions, answer any questions they have\r\n\r\nYou MUST NOT:\r\n\r\n- begin the treatment\r\n- ask about the problem they want to solve\r\n- ask any other personal information\r\n\r\nWhen you have done all this:\r\n\r\n- ask the client if they are ready to start the process?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# GOOD EXAMPLES OF WAYS TO SPEAK FROM EXPERT THERAPISTS\r\n\r\nStarting the conversation\r\n\r\n> Hi <NAME>, welcome to our first session. Today I'll be introducing FIT and I hope we can find something that you want to work on together. Are you happy to start?\r\n\r\nBuilding connection\r\n\r\n> Just, to check, is it okay if I call you <NAME>? I want to make sure I'm using the name you prefer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# CONVERSATION HISTORY\r\n\r\nContinue this conversation:\r\n\r\n{% turns \"step\" %}\r\n\r\n# MAKING YOUR RESPONSE\r\n\r\nThink step by step:\r\n\r\n- What have you said previously? \r\n- Is the client asking you anything? If so, you must answer that first and be sure the answer is sufficient.\r\n- Is there a logical next thing to say?\r\n- Think about how to avoid gaps in the conversation and make it flow naturally and logically\r\n\r\nThink out loud to clarify your ideas. \r\nDon't role play — you are just planning what to say.\r\nBriefly, jot them down note form/abbreviated thoughts:\r\n\r\n[[think:PLANS]]\r\n\r\nNow, respond to the client:\r\n\r\n- in a single sentence (not in quotes)\r\n- NEVER ask more than 1 question \r\n- speak naturally (avoid formality)\r\n- use British English with a neutral dialect\r\n\r\n[[speak:RESPONSE]]"

In Module 2, you’ll strengthen your confidence in making a change. If you are ready to start, you’ll select a first step. \r\nEach of the 2 modules will take about half an hour. I’ll suggest you do them over 2 days, but you can do it all in one session or take more breaks if you want. \r\nWhen you start making a change, I’ll give you as much support as you want, to keep working towards your goal. \r\nOK?\r\n<Sure>\r\nI’ll be using mental imagery to help you make decisions, plan ahead and solve problems. Before we go any further, can I show you what I mean?  \r\n<OK>      \t<SKIP>\r\n\tIf press Skip:\r\n\tOK. If you’d like to learn more about mental imagery later, you can go to PRACTISE IMAGERY in the menu at the top left of the screen.\r\n((jump to $1))\r\nHave you noticed that when you think about something that happened in the past, sometimes it’s like you’re back there again and seeing, hearing and doing the things you did all over again? \r\n<YES>\t\t\t<NO>\r\n\tIf NO—\r\n\tThat’s OK—some people experience this more than others. \r\nIf Yes or No--\r\nThis is what I mean by mental imagery--seeing things with your mind’s eye, hearing things with your mind’s ear, and so on. It’s like living an experience in your mind. \r\nListen to this audio to see how powerful it can be.\r\n[PLAY] \t\t\t\t[NEXT]\r\n I am going to ask you to imagine a situation. Please imagine you are there, and it is happening right now.  Imagine it as vividly as you can.  If you mind wanders, just come back to the image.\r\nImagine you are holding a lemon… \r\nPicture it as vividly as you can, what it looks like, the texture of the skin, whether there is any stem… \r\nWhether the colour is the same across the whole lemon…\r\nWhether there is any light or shade on it…\r\nImagine holding it close up, so you can see every feature…\r\n\r\nNow I want you also to imagine what it feels like to hold it… \r\nImagine what the texture of the lemon would feel like…\r\nThe weight of the lemon in your hand…\r\nIts shape…\r\nWhat it would feel like if you threw it upwards and caught it…\r\nKeep the picture of the lemon there in your imagination….\r\n\r\nImagine holding the lemon next to your nose. That fresh, tangy smell… \r\nNow, imagine cutting it with a knife. Think about how the knife feels, as you grip it and carefully cut the lemon in two. You hear a slight rasping sound as you do that… \r\nSmall drops of juice come out as you cut it…maybe your hand feels a little wet… \r\nImagine what the halves look like—the segments, the texture of the inside of the lemon, white pith…\r\nYou hold half of the lemon to your nose. Smell the juice…\r\nImagine wiping your finger across the surface, and putting a drop on your tongue. A fresh, acid taste. Imagine swallowing it, and feeling it going down your throat. A cool, refreshing sensation.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine taking one of the halves in your hand. You have a glass in your other hand, and you are going to squeeze the juice into the glass…Squeezing it now, and the juice is trickling out…You can hear it going into the glass…Take a sip of the juice, and swallow that…\r\nGo back to squeezing the lemon into the glass…\r\n\r\nIt squirts into your eye! It is stinging you!\r\n_______________________________________ \r\n((When click NEXT:))\r\nHow was that? Did you imagine touching the lemon? Smelling it? Tasting it? Did you flinch when it squirted into your eye? How did it make you feel?\r\nMental images can be almost like something is happening in real life. You can use that later to build your motivation and help you keep going when things get tough.\r\nIf you imagined the lemon clearly, that’s great—if you had trouble keeping your image vivid, that will get better with practice.  \r\nHere is another image that I think you’ll enjoy.\r\n<PLAY>      \t<NEXT>\r\n\t\r\nPLAY goes to an audio about a recent experience they enjoyed\r\n$1 ((NEXT goes here))\r\nOK.

You might find it easiest to close your eyes\r\nImagine you are holding a lemon… \r\nPicture it as vividly as you can, what it looks like, the texture of the skin, whether there is any stem… \r\nWhether the colour is the same across the whole lemon…\r\nWhether there is any light or shade on it…\r\nImagine holding it close up, so you can see every feature…\r\n\r\nNow imagine what it feels like to hold it… \r\nImagine what the texture of the lemon would feel like…\r\nThe weight of the lemon in your hand…\r\nIts shape…\r\nThrow the lemon in the air and catch it. Notice how it feels as it lands in your hand again.\r\n\r\nImagine holding the lemon next to your nose. That fresh, tangy smell… \r\nNow, imagine that the lemon has been cut in half. Imagine what the inside of the lemon looks like, the segments, and white pith.\r\nYou hold one of the halves to your nose. Smell the juice…\r\nImagine wiping your finger across the surface, and putting a drop on your tongue. A fresh, acid taste. Imagine swallowing it, and feeling it going down your throat. A cool, refreshing sensation.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine taking one of the halves in your hand. You have a glass in your other hand, and you are going to squeeze the juice into the glass…Squeezing it now, and the juice is trickling out…You can hear it going into the glass…Take a sip of the juice, and swallow that…\r\nGo back to squeezing the lemon into the glass…\r\nIt squirts into your eye! It is stinging you!\r\n\r\nHow was that? Take a moment to think about which aspects felt most real or vivid. What happened when you imagined the juice squirting in your eye? If you flinched or blinked, that shows how closely imagery is tied to our bodily feelings and reactions. That is one reason we use imagery in FIKA. \r\nIf you couldn’t imagine this scene, please have a look at the next page\r\nExtras\r\nRelaxing\r\nImagine you are on a beach in the morning on a summer’s day.\r\nYou’re lying on a hammock between two palm trees.\r\nYou can hear the water washing on the beach...splashing as the waves break gently on the sand. Seagulls are crying nearby. Children are laughing in the distance.\r\nYou can feel the slight pressure of the hammock on your back.\r\nThe sun is warming your body, and your face is in the shade of the trees.\r\nFeel that warmth on your legs...stomach and chest.\r\nYour feel a slight breeze across your forehead.\r\nThe breeze makes the hammock rock slightly... one way  ... then the other... back and forth.\r\nYou’re feeling warm... and very calm.\r\nListening to the waves... and the seagulls... feeling the hammock rock gently.\r\nEnjoy the feeling for a few moments.\r\n\r\nClimbing a hill\r\nYou have been sitting and studying hard. Now you feel a need for some exercise and fresh air. You go outdoors and start walking. Notice how the day’s tension drops away as you walk. Imagine the scene around you, any people or animals, trees or water. Make the picture as vivid as you can. Now pay attention to any sounds you can hear while you walk. Imagine you are walking up a hill to a viewpoint. You can feel your legs working, your breathing getting deeper. The breeze on your face is getting stronger as you go higher. You have reached the top. Enjoy the feeling of achievement as you take in the view.\r\n\r\nSwimming\r\nIt is summer and you have reached your favourite bathing spot. Imagine where you are, what is around you, the pattern of the light on the water. You dip your fingers in the water. It is quite cold! Now you are ready to swim. Imagine how you feel as you enter the water and start swimming. The sound of the water as you move smoothly through it. The sensation of floating. Now imagine you have finished your swim. You dry yourself in the sunshine. You feel a little tired but refreshed after your swim, and ready to head home.\r\nModule 2\r\nWoodland Walk\r\nImagine you are enjoying a walk in a wood. \r\nNotice what you see around you. Picture the colours, textures as vividly as you can. Perhaps you see sunlight coming through the leaves \r\nNotice how your body feels as you walk, enjoying stretching your legs, relaxing.\r\nIn front of you is a big old oak tree. Reach out and touch its trunk. Imagine the texture of the bark.\r\nCome closer – can you smell the wood? \r\nPause quietly a moment. What you can hear? Imagine how you feel as you stand there, surrounded by nature.\r\n\r\nModule 1 motivational imagery – also module 2\r\nPlease take a moment to get comfortable… relax, close your eyes.\r\nI’d like you to imagine that the changes you wrote about have somehow happened. Don’t worry about how you are going to make them happen. Just imagine that it is sometime in the future and things have got better in the way you want them to get better. You are able to do the things you want without anxiety getting in the way. Try to imagine a specific time and place, maybe an event that you know is coming up in the future. \r\nImagine how things are now \r\nPicture the event unfolding\r\nWhat you are doing,\r\nWho you are with. \r\nImagine what you can hear.\r\nImagine anything you can see and taste. \r\nTry to use all your senses to make it as vivid and real as possible.\r\nNotice things that are better in this future image. \r\nNotice how good it feels to have succeeded.

It doesn’t have to be something that was perfect—the person knows how hard it is.\r\nThey are noticing something that was hard for you to do, and they think you are doing great.\r\nBe that person now, looking at you, and noticing how you are doing.

Take a moment to imagine how things are, in this future.

I’ll give you some time to imagine that new future you.\r\nLet’s think about how to get to that goal.

Experience it as though it is happening right now. If your mind wanders, that’s okay, just come back to the scene and play out the story. \r\n\r\n\r\nCravings buster \r\nOne of the key challenges that can arise when trying to achieve a goal like losing weight or reducing alcohol consumption is managing cravings. A difficult or challenging day can make it even harder to avoid cravings. Giving in can lead to feelings of guilt and make you feel defeated. It is important to remember that these cravings are completely normal and everyone will experience them. It will get easier with time to avoid giving in to cravings if you continue practicing your imagery training. This guide can help you draw upon your imagery skills to try and avoid cravings by looking at your goals and future self. \r\nResearch has shown that when we experience cravings, for example of sugary or high fat foods, we create a vivid image in our mind of that food item, we can smell it and even taste it. \r\nThis following exercise is designed to help you overcome these cravings. You can also use it with any temptation that goes against your plan, for example if you feel tempted to drive rather than walk, or to have a break instead of completing a piece of work, or to procrastinate on a task that is causing you some anxiety.\r\nGaze towards the wall or close eyes, whatever is most comfortable\r\nImagine something that you tend to get a craving for or are tempted by\r\nImagine having it or doing it right now\r\nMake it as vivid as you can, using all your senses…\r\nImagine how it feels, tastes, looks ... focus on making that image really vivid\r\nNow switch that image to your future self, the finale of your mini movie\r\nIts 6 months or a year from now and everything you want to get better is better\r\nNotice how good it feels, \r\nReally indulge in your success and reaching your goal.\r\nSo you can use your imagery to switch your focus to your end goal and focus on how positive it would feel to achieve that goal. Making this imagery as vivid as possible will help strengthen your motivation to stay on track.\r\nWhen you’ve had some practice at the Craving Buster, try the advanced version\r\n \r\nAdvanced cravings buster \r\nThis version of the cravings buster trains you to shift attention from the temptation to the immediate feelings you’ll experience if you give into it, and then to how you will feel if you stick to your plan and continue making progress towards your goal.\r\nImagine one of those difficult situations, when those urges or cravings start to become unmanageable. Make it as real as you can, as though you are almost there re-living that moment now\r\nBriefly imagine the downsides you’ll experience, if you let the cravings win and lose the progress you’ve made\r\nNow, switch your attention to the very immediate positive future, how good you will feel if you stay in charge and do what you planned to do ...how great it will feel as you are doing this instead of giving in. \r\nNotice what you can see around you while you do it, anything you can hear, or smell, or taste. \r\nPlay through the positive actions… you are succeeding in your goal…\r\nNotice how that feels, any positive changes you are experiencing already. \r\nNow play through further into the future, where you have succeeded in sticking to your plan. Notice the good things that are happening as a result. Make it as real and vivid as you can, experiencing those positive emotions, feeling strong or proud of what you have achieved.\r\n\r\nMini motivational movie\r\nClose your eyes...take a breath...relax\r\nImagine taking those first steps towards your goal....doing something today to work on your plan\r\nUse all your senses... imagine where you are, what you can see, hear, smell\r\nPlay forward to this evening...notice how you feel, to have made a start\r\nImagine the next few days... working on your plan successfully\r\nNotice any small things that are getting better in these first days and weeks\r\nNotice how you feel in yourself\r\nPlay forward to the future...you have achieved your goal...\r\nNotice where you are, what you can hear, what is around you...what is better now....how you feel in yourself ...\r\nEnjoy that feeling of success\r\nOvercoming obstacles 2\r\nEven if your plan is going great and you are working on your steps towards your goal obstacles can arise. Using your imagery to anticipate obstacles can be beneficial to alter your plan, if needed, to accommodate for these challenges. For example you may find that birthdays, going out for a meal or having a night in are times that you would find difficult to stick to your plan. \r\nThere are a few steps that you can take to help manage these obstacles. \r\n1.\tUsing the following imagery exercise you can plan how you will manage any obstacles\r\nAsking someone to read this to you or recording yourself on your phone and following along may be helpful, ensure you draw upon all of your senses.\r\n\r\nImagine the steps that you would normally be taking throughout the day, \r\nWhat you would be doing before the event or obstacle,\r\nImagine how good it feels to be sticking to your plan, remember to use all your senses\r\nImagine specific obstacles that could arise and how you might overcome them, \r\nWhat can you put in place to ensure you overcome the obstacle and any challenges you face. \r\nNow switch to an event in the future, you have achieved your goal, imagine how good it feels to be at this event \r\nImagine how good it feels that you have achieved your goal, notice the people around you, the sights and smells and really focus on that positive feeling you get from achieving your goal.\r\n\r\nIf your progress slows down \r\nIt can be very exciting when you first start pushing really hard towards your goal and you start to notice some positive changes. However, with some goals you might notice that your progress slows down after a while. Weight loss is a good example, because your body adjusts to your new eating and exercise habits and processes food more efficiently. It is important to not let this slow-down take your focus away.  \r\nAt this point it is important to remember why you wanted to achieve your goal. What was it about the goal that fitted with your values and who you want to be, the ‘real you’?  \r\nIt is also important to remember at this point how well you have done in working towards your goal. To get to this point you must have made a lot of positive changes and stuck to them. Try and focus on how much you have achieved. \r\nTo help keep your motivation up and not slip into habits that go against your goal, it is beneficial to keep focusing on using your imagery. It is not always helpful to use negative imagery but once you are this close to your goal it may be helpful to use your imagery to think about what your life was like before you started working towards your goal and how you wanted to make these changes, and how at times it felt impossible. \r\nThis imagery exercise can help you focus on how far you have come. Remember to use all your senses to make it really vivid.\r\nIn your imagination, look back to how things were when you began your journey... notice what wasn’t so great, any negative emotions you felt then. \r\nRemind yourself why this goal matters to you, what broader benefits it will bring.\r\nNow, bring to mind the first steps you took and play forward as you successfully made some changes.\r\nNotice how that feels, the changes you’ve experienced in yourself, any positive changes you've noticed.\r\nImagine how things are now. Make it as real and vivid as you can. Notice what has got better, how the progress you have made so far has touched other parts of your life.\r\nIf you have an idea for something extra you can do to work towards your goal, try it out in your imagination now, noticing how it builds on the progress you’ve made already.\r\nIf you aren’t ready to try something extra, that’s fine. Enjoy making your image of how far you’ve come as vivid as you can. Really experience the things that are better now, that you want to hold onto.\r\n\r\nFrom Mirage\r\nA. If abstinent and finding this easier to achieve, develop imagery for new goal. \r\n“Would it be ok if we tried an image a bit further into the future, to see how things look for you a year from now?” \r\n“Imagine one year has gone by and you have kept up with the changes you have made.” “Imagine yourself going about your life.” \r\n“Notice everything about your life, especially the things that are different now you don’t drink.” \r\n“Make the image as vivid as you can..., paying attention to all of the details.” “Use all of your senses. What you see...”\r\n”Hear...”\r\n”Feel...” \r\n“Notice what is different in your future life compared to now.” \r\n“In that image, what other things were different in your life aside from your drinking?” \r\n“What else were you doing differently?” \r\n“It helps to think of changes to your drinking as being just one part of a bigger goal to achieve a happier, healthier, more balanced life. Now that you’ve been achieving your alcohol goal for a while, how do you feel about the idea of setting a new goal for something else you would like to change that would help you achieve the future you want?” \r\nIf the person does not want to set a new goal, express that is okay and suggest it may be something they would like to come back to later. Imagery is a tool they can use whenever they are working on something that requires motivation, planning or confidence. Proceed to summarise and close the session. \r\n“What goal do you think you want to set?”\r\n“How would things be better if you achieved this goal?” “When will you start?” \r\nMIRAGE FIT manual \r\n \r\nWould it be okay to try that out using imagery? \r\nImagine you are getting started, working towards this new goal. Play through the steps you will take to get there\r\nUses all your senses to make it as real as possible\r\nNotice how you feel, as you start to make progress \r\nNow play forward to the future. You are succeeding in your goal. Notice the positive changes, how good you feel \r\nHow did that feel? \r\nReflect positives. \r\nHow confident are you that you can start working towards that goal this week, say on a scale of 0, I’m not at all confident, to 10, I’m completely confident? \r\nRecord answer on Practitioner Record Sheet Respond accordingly: \r\nIf high rating, That’s great, you are quite confident already. Can you tell me what made you say X? \r\nIf medium, You are fairly confident already. Is that enough to make a start? If low and there is time, ask What would it take to make that a bit higher? \r\nIf low and no time, reassure that Confidence increases with practice. You only need a little bit to get started, and we can work on it some more in the next session. Remember that practising imagery can help you stay motivated. \r\nB. If abstinent but still finding this hard to achieve \r\n“Making changes in life can take time to get used to. And it can take a while to work out the best way to work these changes into our usual routines so that they become our new ‘norm’ and we don’t have to think about them so much.” \r\n“It can help to have a look at what things might be getting in your way, and see if there is anything that can be done to make these changes a bit easier for you.” \r\n“Would it be ok if we had a look at what’s been happening, and maybe come up with a plan for how you can work around those things in the coming weeks?” \r\n“What have you been trying to do to ...[goal]?” “What things have been getting in your way?” \r\nMIRAGE FIT manual \r\nPractice cravings buster if they mention that cravings are making it hard \r\n“In imagery mode, imagine one of those difficult situations, when urges or cravings start to become unmanageable. Make it as real as you can, as though you are almost there re-living that moment now” \r\n“Briefly imagine the downsides you’ll experience, if you let the cravings win and lose the progress you’ve made” \r\n“Now, switch your attention to the very immediate positive future, how good you will feel if you stay in charge and do what you planned to do to stay healthy- how great it will feel as you are doing this instead of giving in. Notice what you can see around you while you do it, anything you can hear, or smell, or taste. Play through the positive actions... you are succeeding in your goal...notice how that feels, any positive changes you are experiencing already. Now play through further into the future, where you have succeeded in avoiding alcohol. Notice the good things that are happening as a result. Make it as real and vivid as you can” \r\n“When you are ready... would you mind telling me how that was?” ...[if they don’t mention it spontaneously] “What happened to the craving?” \r\nGenerally, people report that the craving image disappeared, or faded. Encourage them that the more they practice their goal imagery, the more power they will have to beat cravings. \r\n“What do you think you could do in the coming weeks to help you ...[overcome challenges] so that you can ...[goal]?” \r\nWould you like to try some of these out using imagery, to prepare for one of those difficult situations? \r\n“When you’re ready, create an image about that, imagining you are facing ...[challenge], and imagining what you will do” \r\n“Imagine the steps you take before ...[challenge] to get ready.” \r\n“Imagine yourself carrying out each of those steps, as if you were really doing them right now.” \r\n“Keep playing the image through.” \r\n“Now you are in the situation. Imagine what you are doing to get through it, sticking to your goal.” \r\n“Imagine yourself going through all the steps and actions.”\r\n“Make the image as vivid as you can, as if you are there doing it right now.” \r\n“And now let the image keep playing through to after the situation, later that night, and the next morning.” \r\nMIRAGE FIT manual \r\n   \r\n“Imagine what you are doing.” ... “Notice how you are feeling.”\r\n“Notice the positive outcomes from having stuck to your goal”\r\n“How did that feel?”\r\nHelp them to identify which strategies worked well based on their image. Reinforce the positive effects of sticking to their goal. \r\nConsolidate their plan by asking them to articulate what they will do. \r\n“So what will you do next time ...[challenge]?” \r\n“Once you’ve been using imagery for a while it will start to come to you more easily and eventually it will just happen automatically. But in the early stages of learning how to use it, it can help to set reminders for yourself to remember to use imagery. Reminders to practice it before challenging situations in particular can be especially helpful.” \r\n“When do you think would be a good time for you to get a reminder to practise imagery before... [challenge]?” \r\nC. If the person has had a lapse. \r\n“Changing any kind of behaviour you’ve been doing for a long time can be difficult. Having a lapse usually means you experienced a challenge you weren’t prepared for. It doesn’t mean you have failed or that you won’t succeed. Would it be okay to look at how imagery can help you prepare for a challenge in the future? \r\nReview the lapse situation. Identify the challenges involved and elicit patient’s ideas for solutions. \r\nPractice Cravings Buster above if craving led to lapse \r\nThen, \r\n“When you’re ready, create an image of yourself facing [that challenge] again... \r\n“Imagine the steps you take before ...[challenge] to get ready.” \r\n“Imagine yourself carrying out each of those steps, as if you were really doing them right now.” \r\n“Keep playing the image through.” \r\n“Now you are in the situation. Imagine what you are doing to get through it, sticking to your goal.” \r\n“Imagine yourself going through all the steps and actions”\r\n“Make the image as vivid as you can, as if you are there doing it right now.” \r\nMIRAGE FIT manual \r\n \r\n“Use all your senses. What you see... “ “What you hear...” “What you feel...” “Play it through as you succeed in each of these steps... how you feel afterwards” “Notice the positive outcomes from having stuck to your goal.”\r\n“Notice how good you feel, knowing you were able to do it.”\r\n“How did that feel?”\r\n“So what will you do next time ...[challenge]?” \r\n“Once you’ve been using imagery for a while it will start to come to you more easily and eventually it will just happen automatically. But in the early stages of learning how to use it, it can help to set reminders for yourself to remember to use imagery. Reminders to practice it before challenging situations in particular can be especially helpful.” \r\n“When do you think would be a good time for you to get a reminder to practise imagery before... [challenge]?” \r\nD. If the person is still drinking heavily, or has returned to regular drinking \r\nThis section reviews whether abstinence is important to patient and identifies different ways of approaching it, which might include trying to cut down or, if they have been trying to drink in moderation, trying a short period of total abstinence. \r\n“Would it be ok if we talked about your goal some more, and maybe do a bit of a review to see if you’re still happy with the goal you set or if you think you might want to make some changes?” \r\nIf the person does not agree to review their goal, express that this is ok and proceed with pathway A, C or E based on clinical judgement of whether planning to manage lapses or setting a new goal will be most useful for them. If setting a new goal, use hypothetical language: “Imagine one year has gone by and you have been abstinent all that time...” Pathway E is for someone who does not want to address their alcohol use but is willing to use imagery to work on a different goal. \r\n“Back at the start of treatment you set a goal to ...[goal] and thought that you would ...[things that would be better] if you could achieve that.” \r\n“Have your thoughts about any of that changed?” \r\n“Do you feel like you have achieved the changes you wanted to see?” \r\n“Would it be ok if we imagined a hypothetical situation to see if those changes could be improved on or achieved with a different goal?” [if No  Pathway E) \r\nIf the person does not agree to imagine the hypothetical scenario express that is ok and suggest that they may find it helpful to review their goal from time to time to see if it is \r\nMIRAGE FIT manual \r\n  \r\nstill giving them the changes they wanted. Offer to show them how they can use imagery to work on other goals (pathway E). \r\n“When you’re ready, create an image in your mind of you going about your usual day, but in this image you have not been drinking alcohol \r\n“Notice what is different, now that you have been abstinent for a while.” \r\n“Keep playing the image through over a few days. Remember to use all your senses. What you see...” \r\n“Hear...” “Feel...” \r\n“Make it as vivid as you can, as if you are really there experiencing those things now.” \r\n“Notice any changes that happen as the first few days go by.” \r\n“Now cast the image forward to a few weeks later...Now a few months later.” \r\n“How did that feel?” \r\n“How are things different between the changes you saw in your image and the changes you have been experiencing so far?” \r\n“Thinking about that, is there something you’d like to try over the next two weeks? \r\n“What will be better when you achieve this new goal?” \r\nIf the person chooses to update their goal, help them identify steps they need to take to get there. \r\nLet’s try one more imagery exercise if that’s okay, to make sure this plan is going to work. Imagine taking the first steps you need, to work on your goal\r\nPlay it out over a few days, noticing how you feel each time you succeed in staying on track If you hit an obstacle, try to find a way around it, in your imagination. \r\nUse all your senses to make it as real as possible \r\nPlay through to the future... noticing how you feel now you have achieved your goal \r\nHow was that? \r\nHow confident are you that you can start working towards that goal this week, say on a scale of 0, I’m not at all confident, to 10, I’m completely confident? \r\nRecord answer on Practitioner Record Sheet Respond accordingly: \r\nMIRAGE FIT manual \r\n  \r\nIf high rating, That’s great, you are quite confident already. Can you tell me what makes you confident that you can do ths? \r\nIf medium, You are fairly confident already. Is that enough to make a start? If low and there is time, ask What would it take to make that a bit higher? \r\nIf low and no time, reassure that Confidence increases with practice. You only need a little bit to get started, and we can work on it some more in the next session. Remember that practising imagery can help you stay motivated. \r\nE. If still drinking at risky level and unwilling to work towards abstinence \r\nThis pathway teaches how imagery can help achieve goals that matter to them, so that the techniques are available to them when they are ready to address their drinking. Remember that success achieving any goal will build confidence to achieve an abstinence goal should the person decide to tackle it in the future. \r\n“Is there another goal that you would like to work on?”\r\n“That’s important to you because....?”\r\n“How would things be better if you achieved this goal?”\r\n“What first steps would you need to take, to get started on this goal?” Would it be okay to try that out using imagery? \r\nImagine you are getting started, working towards this new goal. Play through the steps you will take to get there\r\nUses all your senses to make it as real as possible\r\nNotice how you feel, as you start to make progress \r\nNow play forward to the future. You are succeeding in your goal. Notice the positive changes, how good you feel \r\nHow did that feel? \r\nReflect positives. \r\nHow confident are you that you can start working towards that goal this week, say on a scale of 0, I’m not at all confident, to 10, I’m completely confident? \r\nRecord answer on Practitioner Record Sheet Respond accordingly: \r\nMIRAGE FIT manual \r\nIf high rating, That’s great, you are quite confident already. Can you tell me what gives you confidence you can do this? \r\nIf medium, You are fairly confident already. Is that enough to make a start? If low and there is time, ask What would it take to make that a bit higher? \r\nIf low and no time, reassure that Confidence increases with practice. You only need a little bit to get started, and we can work on it some more in the next session. Remember that practising imagery can help you stay motivated. \r\nIf judged appropriate, given any resistance earlier in conversation: \r\n“Can I ask, where does alcohol fit into this picture?” \r\nLook for opportunities to elicit or reflect patient’s thoughts on how abstinence might help them achieve this other goal. \r\nEven if the answer is ‘alcohol isn’t relevant’: \r\nReassure that ‘imagery is a tool that you can use whenever you want to do something hard. You can use it for working on any of your goals. You will find it works best if you practice. Is there something that you do each day, like washing your hands, that would remind you to practice?"

Notice the pale yellow of the pulp, the whiteness\r\nof the inner peel, and see whether you have cut through a seed or two. Carefully cut one\r\nof the halves in two........

I heard you are feeling better and want\r\nto get out of here. Can we talk for a few\r\nminutes?\r\nYeah, sure. I feel better and I wanna go. They\r\nwanted me to talk to you first.\r\nGlad to hear you’re feeling better. Makes\r\nsense you’re thinking about getting back to\r\nyour life.\r\nYeah, I haven’t seen my friends in a while.\r\nThey’re really important to you.\r\nYep, when we’re out there, we take care of\r\neach other and I’m worried how they’re doing.\r\nThat’s part of why you came here—to look out\r\nfor them.\r\nExactly. No one else does; we have to watch\r\nout for each other.\r\nIt makes sense. Thinking about taking care of\r\nthem, what do you already know about how\r\nlong it’s recommended people stay after they\r\nstart feeling better?\r\nWell, I know I’m supposed to stay here for a\r\nfew more days but I’m feeling worried about\r\nmy friends because right now, there’s no way\r\nto get in touch with them.\r\nYour friends’ safety has been on your mind a\r\nlot.\r\nYeah, one of my friends is older and has\r\ndiabetes.\r\nThat’s part of why you came here—to avoid\r\nexposing him to the virus.\r\nYeah, I would be really bummed if he got sick\r\nbecause of me.\r\nDepartment of Community and Human Services\r\nBehavioral Health and Recovery Division\r\nSupporting guests at COVID-19 isolation and quarantine sites: A jump start in using Motivational\r\nInterviewing (MI): Sample conversation using Elicit – Provide – Elicit (03 26 2020)\r\nKing County MI trainers: Jennifer Wyatt, LMHC, MAC, SUDP and Margaret Soukup, MA\r\nThanks to Seattle-area MI trainer and author, David Rosengren, PhD, for refining this example.\r\nTEAM MEMBER GUEST\r\nYou made a responsible choice.\r\nI sure hope so.\r\nWould it be OK if I shared why we ask people\r\nto stay for a particular amount of time?\r\nYeah because I thought If I don’t have a fever\r\nor a cough, I should be good to go.\r\nIt ought to be safe for you to leave.\r\nYeah. If I’m feeling better, I’m not going to\r\nmake anyone sick.\r\nYou’re on to something there. Is it OK if I add\r\nto what you already know about the three\r\nindicators the Centers for Disease Control\r\nlooks for?\r\nSure.\r\nThe CDC guidelines to stop the spread of this\r\nvirus include not having a fever, like you said.\r\nThey recommend not having a fever for 72\r\nhours without taking fever-reducing\r\nmedication.\r\nI didn’t realize it was not having a fever\r\nwithout taking medication. I just stopped that\r\nyesterday.\r\nYou might need a bit more time there.\r\nUgh, damn.\r\nThe second indicator is not having a cough or\r\nshortness of breath.\r\nYeah I haven’t been coughing in a while. I\r\nnever had shortness of breath.\r\nDepartment of Community and Human Services\r\nBehavioral Health and Recovery Division\r\nSupporting guests at COVID-19 isolation and quarantine sites: A jump start in using Motivational\r\nInterviewing (MI): Sample conversation using Elicit – Provide – Elicit (03 26 2020)\r\nKing County MI trainers: Jennifer Wyatt, LMHC, MAC, SUDP and Margaret Soukup, MA\r\nThanks to Seattle-area MI trainer and author, David Rosengren, PhD, for refining this example.\r\nTEAM MEMBER GUEST\r\nSo far, you no longer have a cough and you\r\nnever had shortness of breath. You’re making\r\nprogress on the fever; we’re aiming for 72\r\nhours on that one.\r\nThat sounds right.\r\nAnd the third indicator from the CDC is more\r\nthan 7 days since your symptoms first started.\r\nI think it’s been less than that but I’m not sure.\r\nThat’s something we can find out.\r\nSo, even though I’m feeling better, I could still\r\nbe contagious?\r\nThat’s what you’re wondering.\r\nYeah, you know, my cough is better, and my\r\nfever finally broke, but I can’t quite remember\r\nwhen my symptoms started.\r\nYou don’t want to leave if you’re contagious\r\nand risk getting others sick, like your friend\r\nwith diabetes. If you want, I can check with the\r\nnurse about when your symptoms started.\r\nYeah, that might be good. And for sure, I don’t\r\nwant to make anyone sick. No offense, but this\r\nplace sucks.\r\nIt’s no fun being somewhere you don’t want to\r\nbe.\r\nExactly.\r\nLet me summarize what we talked about: You\r\nare making progress on the 3 CDC indicators.\r\nI’ll check with the nurse to find out when your\r\nsymptoms started. A big part of why you’re\r\nhere is for your friends. You don’t want them\r\nto be sick and suffer like you did.\r\nDepartment of Community and Human Services\r\nBehavioral Health and Recovery Division\r\nSupporting guests at COVID-19 isolation and quarantine sites: A jump start in using Motivational\r\nInterviewing (MI): Sample conversation using Elicit – Provide – Elicit (03 26 2020)\r\nKing County MI trainers: Jennifer Wyatt, LMHC, MAC, SUDP and Margaret Soukup, MA\r\nThanks to Seattle-area MI trainer and author, David Rosengren, PhD, for refining this example.\r\nTEAM MEMBER GUEST\r\nObviously, I really do want to get out of here,\r\nbut I don’t want my friends to deal with this\r\ncrap, too.\r\nYou’d feel crappy if you gave it to one of your\r\nfriends.\r\nYes, and they’d be pissed at me.\r\nI wonder where that leaves you now.\r\nWell, I really want to leave, but I probably\r\nshould stay for a little longer.\r\nYou want to be sure you’re not contagious\r\nanymore.\r\nYeah.\r\nCan I talk to the nurse to see how much longer\r\nI need to stay?\r\nSure. Let me find out when they can talk to\r\nyou. In the meantime, I have this fact sheet\r\nwith more information on those three\r\nindicators from the CDC we talked about. Is it\r\nOK if I leave it outside your door?\r\nSure.\r\nOne last thing: Would it be OK to check in with\r\nyou after you talk to the nurse?\r\nThat works.\r\nGreat. All of us here want people to get\r\nthrough this as safely and comfortably as\r\npossible. You’re getting close, and we want to\r\nhelp you through the home stretch.\r\nThat makes sense.\r\nHey, while we’re on the phone, I could use\r\nsome more Gatorade, and maybe something\r\nto read.\r\nDepartment of Community and Human Services\r\nBehavioral Health and Recovery Division\r\nSupporting guests at COVID-19 isolation and quarantine sites: A jump start in using Motivational\r\nInterviewing (MI): Sample conversation using Elicit – Provide – Elicit (03 26 2020)\r\nKing County MI trainers: Jennifer Wyatt, LMHC, MAC, SUDP and Margaret Soukup, MA\r\nThanks to Seattle-area MI trainer and author, David Rosengren, PhD, for refining this example.\r\nTEAM MEMBER GUEST\r\nI can get all of that for you. I’ll leave it outside\r\nyour door along with the fact sheet, and find\r\nout when the nurse is available. We’ll talk\r\nagain after you check in with the nurse.\r\nSounds good.\r\nThank you."

    "text": "SAMPLE MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING SESSION SCRIPT HANDOUT\r\nEnsure that the Readiness Ruler is administered just before the session, ideally by someone other than you.\r\nOpening Statement\r\n• I’m not here to preach to you or tell you what you “should” do; how would I know, it’s your life and not mine! I believe people know what’s best for them.\r\n• I don’t have an agenda, just a goal: to see if there is anything about the way you take care of your health that you would like to change, and if so, to see if I can help you get there.\r\n• How does that sound to you?\r\nThe Session\r\nBegin with a general question regarding their health and health-related behavior. For example, “I’m curious— how happy are you with how well you take care of your health?”\r\n• Follow up by using all your best MI skills: reflections, open-ended questions, affirmations, and eliciting change talk (e.g., “You said you feel you could be doing better. In what way?”). The overall goal here is to communicate a genuine desire to understand, not a desire to push them into anything.\r\n• Try to stay focused on health-related behavior. This part should take 5–10 minutes, but could be more or less depending on the client.\r\nNext, mention that you have some information to share, if it’s OK with them. “I’ve got some information here that’s related to you and your health. Is it OK with you if we go over this a minute?”\r\n• Remember the keys to good feedback: Be completely objective (you are providing them with information that they can take or leave, you are NOT evaluating them). Never argue, and ask a simple question: “What do you make of all this?”\r\n• Follow up with reflections, etc. Be sure to use the Pros and Cons exercise and at least one other strategy to elicit change talk, usually the Readiness Ruler (“On a 0–10 scale, if 0 is not in the least bit ready to see the doctor at least once every 3 months and 10 is as fired up as you can be, where are you?) Remember with the Readiness Ruler to ask, “Why a 3 and not a 0?” if they give you a low number, and “Why such a high number?” if they give a high number (7 or higher).\r\n• Remember, never argue, never push, just be curious and accepting. There’s no hurry. Remember also, the goal here is to maximize change talk by using questions that elicit change talk, by asking for explanation (if they give a little, ask for more details), and by using exercises like Pros and Cons or the Readiness Ruler.\r\nWhen there are 5–10 minutes left in your session (or when you feel like you’re not going to get any further with Phase I), move into Phase II.\r\n• Do a good summary of everything that’s been said so far. “Let me see if I understand where you’re at with your health right now. . . .” Summarize the things they feel good about and the positive health behav- iors you have noticed, starting with general health stuff and ending with specific stuff about their attending doctor’s appointments. Next, move into the things that concern them in general, and things that concern them about appointments in particular. Note, if there is one, the disparity between recommended number of appointments and the number they kept last year. Ask if your summary is about right. If not, correct it.\r\nEnsure that the Readiness Ruler is administered after the session, ideally by someone other than you.\r\nRevised 8/6/04\r\n52\r\nReturn to Table of Contents"
